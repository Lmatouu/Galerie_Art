# Galerie_Art
The aim of the project was to represent the zone  guarded by an art gallery expressed as an n-sided polynomial. Area calculations and the search for different methods (using superposition detection, polynomial corners or barycenters) were used to optimize the program.  Use of the Python programming language and the Tkinter library.

The main program groups together the 3 methods A,B,C and the game, with a menu and 4 buttons redirecting to these windows.

The sub-programs are the 4 independent programs for each method and the game. 

To play, run the python program Programme_Principale_MathisVEBER
